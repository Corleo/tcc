License note:
esp-open-sdk is in its nature merely a makefile, and is in public domain. However, the toolchain this makefile builds consists of many components, each having its own license. You should study and abide them all.

Quick summary: gcc is under GPL, which means that if you're distributing a toolchain binary you must be ready to provide complete toolchain sources on the first request.

Since version 1.1.0, vendor SDK comes under modified MIT license. Newlib, used as C library comes with variety of BSD-like licenses. libgcc, compiler support library, comes with a linking exception. All the above means that for applications compiled with this toolchain, there are no specific requirements regarding source availability of the application or toolchain. (In other words, you can use it to build closed-source applications). (There're however standard attribution requirements - see licences for details).
